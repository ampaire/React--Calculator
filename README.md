## INTRODUCTION
In this project, I learnt how to build a very simple React application. It is a real-world project for a fictional company that requires my help. The project was split into multiple milestones, and each milestone had functional and technical requirements that I needed to implement.

### OBJECTIVE

Math-magicians is a fictional company based in France. They have requested my help to build a simple product that would assist them with their calculations. An important thing to notice is that they have asked for a product that is not just fully-functional, but also beautiful and user-friendly.

- React-DOM
- React-Create-App
- npm

### REPOSITORY
https://github.com/ampaire/react-calculator


### SETTING UP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

##### Quick start
```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

```
Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.

When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with ``npm run build``.

##### Creating an App
You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

**npx**
``
npx create-react-app my-app
``
**npm**

``
npm init react-app my-app
``
**Yarn**
``
yarn create react-app my-app
``

##### output

    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js

    └── serviceWorker.js

```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app. Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:
 ``cd my-app``

#### AVAILABLE SCRIPTS

In the project directory, you can run:

`yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

 `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

 `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
